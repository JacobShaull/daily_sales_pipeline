# Daily Sales Pipeline Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Daily Sales Pipeline Dashboard** built using **Flask, SQLite, and Matplotlib**. It processes and visualizes sales data from a synthetic retail dataset, showcasing key insights such as total sales, product trends, and gender-based purchasing behavior. The project is deployed online using **Render**.

## 🎯 What This Project Solves

✅ **Automates manual reporting** – Instead of manually analyzing sales data, the dashboard provides real-time insights.
✅ **Identifies key business trends** – Helps businesses make data-driven decisions (e.g., tracking best-selling products, understanding customer behavior).
✅ **Saves time and reduces human error** – A streamlined and automated process for analyzing sales trends.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python (Flask, Pandas, Matplotlib)** – For data processing, visualization, and web development.
- **SQLite** – Lightweight database for storing sales data.
- **Render** – Deployment platform to host the dashboard.
- **GitHub** – Version control and project tracking.

## 📊 Key Insights from the Data

### **1️⃣ Product Sales Trends**

- **Electronics had the highest total revenue** (\$334,340), but **Clothing was the most purchased category by quantity**.
- **Beauty had the lowest revenue overall** but still performed well in transactions.

### **2️⃣ Gender-Based Purchasing Behavior**

- **Women outspent men across all categories**, which was unexpected.
- **Men spent the most on Electronics**, aligning with common trends.
- **Surprisingly, women also spent nearly as much on Electronics as they did on Clothing.**
- **Beauty, typically expected to be a top category for women, was their third-highest spending category.**

### **3️⃣ Sales Distribution & Pricing Trends**

- **Most purchases fell within the \$100-\$499 range**, suggesting that mid-tier products drive the majority of transactions.
- **High-ticket items (\$500+) were less frequent but had a significant revenue impact.**
